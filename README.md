## Awesome Linguistics
----------------------
This repository like many other awesome* repositories on github
is a curated list of all material related to linguistics.

Linguistics has several subfields. The actual number can vary 
depending upon the granularity intended, but broadly the field can
be divided into five categories. [William Labov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Labov), one of the pioneering
American linguist defined these categories based on the places "we 
would find a linguist to work: the library, the bush, the closet, the
laboratory and the street". Based on what kind of work a linguist
may do at these places, one can list some of the subfields as follows:

|Places           | Subfields                                                       |
